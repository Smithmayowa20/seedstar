# Userlist

Make an application which stores names and email addresses in a database (SQLite is fine). a) Has welcome page in http://localhost/ - this page has links to list and create functions b) Lists all stored names / email address in http://localhost/list c) Adds a name / email address to the database in http://localhost/add - should validate input and show errors

This is a django based application so please make sure you use correctly all of django infrastructure (form, template inheritance, ORM). Also make sure the app does not have major security problems: CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection.
