#Jenkins_Api

Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org/) is a open source continuous integration server.

Create a script, in Python, that uses Jenkins' API to get a list of jobs and their status from a given jenkins instance. The status for each job should be stored in an sqlite database along with the time for when it was checked.

#Installation
Go to this directory
cd seedstar/jenkins_api

Then install all requirements
pip install requirements.txt

And execute the jenkins_script.py
